1.	 Which class would you use to store your birthday in years, months, days, seconds, and nanoseconds?

	 You could use the LocalDateTimeClass, along with the Period class to give the date in the units desired

2.	 Given a random date, how would you find the date of the previous Thursday?

	 The Previous method of TemporalAdjuster can be used to find it

3.	 What is the difference between a ZoneId and a ZoneOffset?
	 
	 ZoneOffest only tracks the offset from Greenwich/UTC time while ZoneId also tracks the offset but in relation to a particular 

4.	 How would you convert an Instant to a ZonedDateTime? How would you convert a ZonedDateTime to an Instant?

	 For the first part you can convert an instant to a ZoneDateTinme using ofInstant, while also supplying a Zone Id
	 For the second part, ZoneDateTime has the method toInstant to convert it to an Instant
    
5.	 Write an example that, for a given year, reports the length of each month within that year.

	 For (Month month : Month.values()){
	 	YearMonth ym = YearMonth.of(year, month);
	 	System.out.println(ym.lenghtOfMonth() + " " + month + " " + year

6.	 Write an example that, for a given month of the current year, lists all of the Mondays in that month.
	 
	 System.out.print("Enter the month you'd like to see all the Mondays of : ");
	 String i = sc.nextLine();
	 
	 Month month1 = Month.valueOf(i);
	 LocalDate local = Year.now().atMonth(month1).atDay(1).with(TemporalAdjusters.FirstInMonth(DayOfWeek.MONDAY);
	 Month month2 = local.getMonth();
	 
	 while(month1 == month2){
	 	  System.out.printf(%s%n, local);
	 	  local = local.with(TemproalAdjusters.next(DayOfWeek.MONDAY));
	 	  month2 = local.getMonth();
	 };

7.	 Write an example that tests whether a given date occurs on Friday the 13th.

	 u_month = sc.nextLine();
	 u_day = sc.nextInt();
	 
	 Month month = Month.valueOf(u_month);
	 date = Year.now().atMonth(u_month).atDay(u_day);
	 
	 if(date.get(ChronoField.DAY_OF_MONTH) == 13 && date.get(ChronoField.DAY_OF_WEEK) == 5){
	 	System.out.print("The date is on Friday the 13th");
	 	}
